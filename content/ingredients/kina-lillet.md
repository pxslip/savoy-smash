## Description

While still produced, though under a slightly different name of Lillet Blanc, there is some debate over the accuracy of the modern recipe and the original one. Some believe that the recipe was altered in the 70s to make it sweeter and less bitter. Erik Ellestad of the Savoy Stomp prefers Cocchi Americano when a recipe calls for Kina Lillet. Another alternative he mentions is Tempus Fugit's Kina l’Avion d’Or, which was apparently formulated specifically to replicate the older recipe of Kina Lillet.
