## Description

A neutral alcohol distilled with botanicals of any sort, though the mixture must contain Juniper berries to be considered gin.

Gin comes in many styles, and is distilled all over the world. Unless specifically noted, when a recipe calls for Gin you are free to use whatever gin you fancy. However, there are a few styles that I would recommend sticking to the original if you can:

- London/London Dry: This style is probably the least fussy, but does have a notably distinct flavor profile
- Plymouth: Only produced in one location, though they recently (recently as of 2024) declined trade protections for the name. If the worst should happen and copycats start flooding the market, try to look for bottles distilled in Plymouth, England
- Old Tom/Tom: Again, while similar to London Gin, this style tends toward sweeter so can influence the flavor of your cocktail

## Notes

While there are some that are quite excellent, watch American Gin. While not legally defined, the style tends toward a flavor even more aggressive than London Dry, often overpowering cocktails.
