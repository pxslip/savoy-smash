## Description

Source of the Jamaican jerk, this liqueur was marketed as a tonic. Due to prohibition the producer was required to retain enough solids to make it unpalatable. One producer, while attempting to bypass this rule, added a compound later discovered to be a neurotoxin. This lead to thousands of consumers losing the ability to use their legs and arms.

## Notes

A similar product can be made quite easily by adding 150-300 drops of ginger oil to a bottle of high-proof alcohol, e.g. Everclear.
