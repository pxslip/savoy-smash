# {{$doc.title}}

The Vie Rose is essentially a sour-style cocktail with gin base. What makes it standout it the Kirsch and Grenadine, both offering a more complex fruit-forward flavor that enhances the drink. You will find it necessary to play with the amount of lemon juice and/or Grenadine to balance the sweetness of the cocktail.
